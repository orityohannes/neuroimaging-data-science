10.1.1.1
The color keywords argument can be added to each ax.plot() call to assign a different named color 
such as red, blue, or green. To each line so that the three lines are easier to distinguish. 

10.1.2.1
You would determine the global min and max FA values across the entire dataset (across all tracts, young & old)
Then inside the loop where each subplot is created you would apply: ax.flat[i].set_ylim([min_FA, max_FA])
Every subplot uses the same FA scale, so differences between tracts are not visually disorted by different axis limits.
