Chapter 2: Unix Shell Operating System
Introduces the Unix shell as a foundational tool for interacting with a computer system
through text-based commands. It highlights how the command line enables efficient file
management, automation, and reproducible workflows.

Key Points
- Core commands include:
  - ls (list files)
  - cd (change directory)
  - pwd (show current directory)
  - mkdir (create directory)
  - touch (create file)
  - rm (remove files)
- Redirection and pipes (>, >>, |) enable chaining commands and writing output to
files.
- Using the shell supports reproducibility, especially when running data processing
workflows across different systems.

Chapter 3: Version Control
Explains the importance of version control for managing changes in software and data
analysis projects. It focuses on Git, a widely-used tool that tracks modifications, supports
collaboration, and preserves project history.

Key Points
- Version control helps track who made changes, when, and why.
- Git workflow:
  1. git init to start a repository
  2. git add to stage changes
  3. git commit to save changes with a message
  4. git log to review project history
- Branches allow development without affecting the stable main version.
- Collaboration with GitHub:
  - Remote repositories allow multiple contributors.
  - git push uploads changes, git pull downloads changes.
  - Pull requests enable review and discussion before merging.
- Merge conflicts can occur when multiple users edit the same lines; these must be
resolved manually.
- Git is not suitable for large datasets; Datalad is recommended for data versioning.

Chapter 4: Computational Environments & Containers
Focuses on managing computational environments to ensure reproducibility and
portability. It introduces containers as a modern solution for packaging software,
dependencies, and configurations together.

Key Points
- A computational environment includes:
  - Operating system
  - Software packages and dependencies
  - Configuration settings
- Containers package code, libraries, and runtime environments into a self-contained
unit.
- Docker is the most widely-used container platform:
  - Dockerfile defines the environment setup.
  - Image is the packaged environment.
  - Container is a running instance of an image.
- Containers ensure code runs consistently across different machines, improving
reproducibility.
- They are essential for sharing research workflows and running complex analysis
pipelines.

Chapter 5: A Brief Introduction to Python
Introduces Python as a core language for scientific computing, emphasizing readability,
flexibility, and broad applicability in research and industry.

Key Points
- Python is a high-level, interpreted language:
  - Code executes line by line
- Python emphasizes readable, intuitive syntax:
  - English-like keywords
  - Indentation enforces structure and clarity
- Python is general-purpose:
  - Used in data science, neuroimaging, web development, and industry
- Strong community and ecosystem:
  - Extensive libraries, documentation, and support
- Widely used in neuroimaging research and required for many data science roles

Chapter 6: The Python Environment
Discusses tools and practices that support efficient Python development, including
editors, debugging, testing, and performance profiling.

Key Points
- A development environment includes tools to:
  - Write
  - Run
  - Debug
  - Test code
- Code-specific editors improve productivity by offering:
  - Syntax and error highlighting
  - Automatic code completion
  - Integrated execution and debugging
- Debugging is a normal and unavoidable part of programming:
  - print() inspects values and assumptions
  - assert checks conditions and fails early with meaningful errors
  - pdb (program database) allows pausing execution to inspect program state
- Testing improves code reliability:
  - Unit tests verify individual functions
  - Automated tests prevent regressions and support refactoring
- Profiling measures performance and scalability:
  - %timeit evaluates runtime
  - Scaling analysis is critical for large datasets and neuroimaging workflows

Chapter 7: Share Code with Others
Focuses on turning analysis code into reusable scientific software that other, and your future self, can easily install, understand, test, and use. 

Key Points
-	Don’t keep important code only in notebooks
  o	Move reusable code into .py files
-	Keep code organized 
-	Put related function into one file (a module)
-	Turn that file into a folder with ___init___.py (a package)
  o	Makes it easier to import and reuse
-	Organize your project like a real software project
-	Use pyproject.toml so your code can be installed with python -m pip install
-	Write simple tests to make sure your function work (using Pytest)
-	Use GitHub to automatically run tests when code changes
-	Add documentation so others understand how to use your code
-	Use Zendo (repo archives research software, data, and code) to give software a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) so it can be cited
