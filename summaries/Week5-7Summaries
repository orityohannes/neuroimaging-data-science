Chapter 11: Data Science Tools for Neuroimaging
Explores specialized Python software and organizational standards designed to handle the complexities of neuroimaging data. Emphasizes the support of reproducible pipelines and automated analysis. 

Key Points
  -	The NiPy Ecosystem: A family of Python tools specifically focused on neuroimaging data analysis tasks 
    o	Nibabel: The foundational library used to read and write a variety of common neuroimaging file formats. 
    o	Modality-Specfic Libraries: specialized tools for fMRI, dMRI, etc.
    o	Nipype: A library that allows researchers to glue together different software tools into reproducible analysis pipelines
  -	The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS): A community standard for organizing experimental data metadata to ensure it is both human and machine readable
    o	Optimization Rules: Data is arranged in a strict hierarchy using specific naming conventions based on key-value pairs. 
    o	Metadata: JSON “sidecar” files store acquisition parameters and follow an “inheritance principle” to avoid data redundancy
    o	Ecosystem Benefits: BIDS enables the use of BIDS-Apps like fMRIPrep for automated preprocessing and PyBIDS for programmatic data querying.

Chapter 12: Reading Neuroimaging Data with Nibabel
Introduces how to load and inspect neuroimaging data files using Python, focusing on the NIfTI (Nueroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format and demonstrating how to evaluate MRI data quality before analysis. 

Key Points
  -	Using Nibabel: Loads NIfTI neuroimaging files and reads metadata first before loading full data into NumPy arrays.
  -	BIDS-Organized Data: Example dataset from OpenNeuro shows standardized file structures help tools locate and process data.
  -	Data Quality Check: Introduces temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) to measure MRI data reliability.
  -	Automated Tools: MRIQC and Nipype can compute quality metrics and generate reports using BIDS datasets. 

Chapter 13: Using Nibabel to Align Different Measurements
Explains how MRI scans with different resolutions, orientation, and fields of view can be aligned using metadata stored in MIfTI files, especially the affine matrix.

Key Points
  -	MRI scans like BOLD and T1 often have different shapes and resolutions, so they do not align automatically.
  -	Image registration aligns scans taken under different conditions or positions.
  -	The affine matrix (4×4) in each NIfTI file describes voxel size, orientation, and position in the scanner.
  -	MRI coordinates often use the RAS system (Right, Anterior, Superior).
  -	Matrix multiplication and the inverse affine help convert coordinates between scans.
  -	Nibabel can resample one scan into another’s space, so they align.
  -	Resampling uses interpolation, which slightly changes data values.
